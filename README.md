## Notes

This project was for more for me to learn animations, frontend libraries, and media queries. Had alot of fun and learned alot throughout testing new libraries. Three.js was my favorite by far, but I didn't add it to the final product. I do plan on adding Three.js to a future project due to how insanely easy it is to use to build insane 3D animations. </br>

In this project, I learned: </br>

- How to use SASS instead of CSS. Reduces the # of lines I have to write and repeat.
- Use of GSAP and Kute.js to create frontend animations.
- CSS pseudo elements and new properties, such as transition and animation.
- Use of an external service (formspree) to deliver messages to my email. I thought about using php and attempted it, but formspree was cheaper and easier and gets the job done as well.
- Use of Vite to see instant changes when I save my file.

Things to improve on for future projects: <br/>

- Plan out themes/designs for the project instead of building without an end product in mind. <br/>
- Use font sizes that are not px (em/rem) <br/>
- Make more reusable components instead of copy and pasting code onto different components
- Use jQuery more. Learned jQuery half way through this project and it helped alot, will use it more in future projects
